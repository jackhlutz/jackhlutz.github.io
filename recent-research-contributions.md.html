**Selected Recent Research Contributions**

* (with Xiang Huang and Andrei Migunov) Development of the theory of algorithmic randomness for *individual* trajectories of stochastic chemical reaction networks and, more generally, continuous-time Markov chains. Submitted.  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13620)

* (with Xiang Huang, Elvira Mayordomo, and Don Stull) Use of asymptotic Kullback-Leibler divergences to *quantify* the exponential rates of winning and losing on the two sides of the 1972 Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem for finite-state gamblers betting on normal and non-normal sequences. Submitted.  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13615)

* (with Titus Klinge and Jim Lathrop) A uniform method for translating arbitrary nondeterministic finite automata into deterministic mass-action I/O chemical reaction networks that simulate them in real time with a number of chemical species that is linear in the size of the DFA.  Proof that this simulation is correct and robust to perturbations of both the environment and internal parameters of the I/O chemical reaction networks. Submitted.   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03931)
