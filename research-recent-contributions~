(with Dave Doty, Matt Patitz, Robbie Schweller, Scott Summers, and Damien Woods)  Proof that Winfree’s abstract Tile Assembly Model of nanoscale self-assembly is <i>intrinsically universal</i>, meaning that there is a single tile assembly system U that can be initialized to <i>carry out</i> the self-assembly process of any tile assembly system T.
