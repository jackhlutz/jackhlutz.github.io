<h1 align="center">Computational Complexity </h1>
I am primarily interested in the NP problem (What is the power of nondeterminism?), 
  the BPP problem (What is the power of randomness?), and complexity in analysis
  (especially geometric measure theory).  I have developed three 
  analytic tools for investigating these problems:
<ul>
<li>
Resource-bounded category (1987)
</li>
<li>
Resource-bounded measure (1991)
</li>
<li>
Resource-bounded dimension (2000)
</li>
</ul>
These are complexity-theoretic generalizations of classical Baire category, Lebesgue measure, and Hausdorff dimension
(fractal dimension), respectively. Each provides a mathematical means of quantifying the sizes of
subsets of various complexity classes.
<br><br>
In recent years, many investigators have worked with these
tools, extending them and using them to shed new light on
a wide variety of topics in computational complexity.
I enjoy being a part of this ongoing effort.
